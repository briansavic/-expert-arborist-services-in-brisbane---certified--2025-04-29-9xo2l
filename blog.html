                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Tree removal in Brisbane is crucial for disease prevention and maintaining urban forest health. Diseased trees can spread infections, become structurally unstable, and pose risks to property and people. Common diseases in Brisbane's subtropical climate include Myrtle Rust, Phytophthora Root Rot, and Dutch Elm Disease. Professional arborists use specialized equipment and techniques to safely remove large infected trees. While cost concerns exist, delaying removal often leads to greater expenses. Quick intervention is essential to prevent disease spread, and homeowners should choose certified professionals who understand disease management and comply with local regulations. Alternative treatments may be possible for early-stage infections, but removal is often the safest option for severely diseased trees.</p>
