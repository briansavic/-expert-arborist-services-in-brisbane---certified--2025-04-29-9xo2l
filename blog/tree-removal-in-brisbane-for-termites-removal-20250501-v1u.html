                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8">Termites are among the most destructive pests that can infest trees, causing severe structural damage and posing risks to nearby properties. In Brisbane, where lush greenery is abundant, homeowners often face the challenge of dealing with termite-infested trees.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Threat of Termites to Trees in Brisbane</h2>
                <p>Termites thrive in warm, humid climates, making Brisbane an ideal environment for these pests. They primarily feed on cellulose, which is found in wood, making trees a prime target. Over time, termite infestations weaken trees, leading to:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
                    <li>Structural instability</li>
                    <li>Spread to nearby structures</li>
                    <li>Reduced tree health</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-6">Why Professional Tree Removal is Necessary</h2>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">1. Safety Concerns</h3>

                <p>Termites can spread if infested wood is not disposed of correctly. Experts ensure that all debris is removed and treated to prevent reinfestation.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">3. Comprehensive Inspection</h3>

                <p>Large trees present unique challenges, especially when infested with termites. Their size and weight require specialized equipment and expertise. Professional removal involves:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
                    <li>Crane-assisted removal</li>
                    <li>Sectional dismantling</li>
                    <li>Stump grinding</li>
