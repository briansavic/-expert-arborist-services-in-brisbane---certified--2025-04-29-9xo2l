                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8">When it comes to maintaining the safety and aesthetics of your property, tree removal for path clearing is a critical service that homeowners and businesses often require. Whether it's for creating accessible walkways, preventing hazards, or enhancing landscape design, removing trees that obstruct paths demands expertise, efficiency, and affordability.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-6">Why Path Clearing Requires Professional Tree Removal</h2>
                <p>Path clearing is more than just cutting down trees—it involves strategic planning to ensure safety, minimal environmental impact, and compliance with local regulations. Brisbane's subtropical climate encourages rapid tree growth, which can lead to branches or entire trees encroaching on walkways, driveways, and public paths.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Safety Concerns</h3>
                <p>Overgrown trees can pose significant risks, especially during storms or high winds. Falling branches or uprooted trees can block paths, damage property, or even cause injuries. Professional tree removal ensures that hazardous trees are safely dismantled without endangering nearby structures or people.</p>
